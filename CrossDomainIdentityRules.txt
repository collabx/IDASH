Abstract	A Trustmark Definition specifies the normative conformance criteria that a Trustmark Recipient must meet, as well as the formal assessment process that a Trustmark Provider must perform to assess whether the Trustmark Recipient qualifies for the trustmark. There can be many different types of trustmarks, and each type of trustmark has its own Trustmark Definition. Formally, a Trustmark Definition exists as an eXtensible Markup Language (XML) object that conforms to the normative structure and rules for Trustmark Definitions as defined by the Trustmark Framework Technical Specification, which is located at https://trustmark.gtri.gatech.edu/specifications/trustmark-framework. In addition, a Trustmark Definition may be represented in other formats, e.g., HTML, for greater human readability. Use the link below to visit the index page for all Trustmark Definitions developed under this project. Each Trustmark Definition is provided in both XML and HTML format.

Abstract	Working Group Name: International Government Assurance Profile (iGov) The purpose of this working group is to develop a security and privacy profile of the OpenID Connect specifications that allow users to authenticate and share consented attribute information with public sector services across the globe. The resulting profile will enable standardized integration with public sector relying parties in multiple jurisdictions. The profile will be applicable to, but not exclusively targeted at, identity broker-based implementations.

PEER: Public Endpoint Entities Registry

Type	Web Page
URL	https://reep.refeds.org/
Accessed	8/4/2015, 5:00:00 PM
Abstract	PEER is envisioned as a lightweight, global registrar for SAML Metadata representing both SAML and non-SAML endpoints (e.g., OpenID, IMI). It is intended as a focused activity to catalyze international use of federated identity. The service is not intended to be a replacement for federation or inter-federation, but is intended to be a tool supporting such activities. The service is intended to be operational by July 2011. It will be operated by an interim operator as a proof-of-concept and move to a permanent home if the service is seen as useful. Part of the PEER project will include an analysis of sustainability for PEER. -- https://spaces.internet2.edu/display/PEER/Home

RFC 6962: Certificate Transparency

Institution	IETF
Report Type	Request for Comments - Category: Experimental
Abstract	This document describes an experimental protocol for publicly logging the existence of Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates as they are issued or observed, in a manner that allows anyone to audit certificate authority (CA) activity and notice the issuance of suspect certificates as well as to audit the certificate logs themselves. The intent is that eventually clients would refuse to honor certificates that do not appear in a log, effectively forcing CAs to add all issued certificates to the logs. Logs are network services that implement the protocol operations for submissions and queries that are defined in this document.

Abstract	A Trustmark is a machine-readable, cryptographically signed digital artifact, issued by a Trustmark Provider to a Trustmark Recipient, and relied upon by one or more Trustmark Relying Parties. A Trustmark represents an official attestation by the Trustmark Provider of conformance by the Trustmark Recipient to a well-defined set of requirements pertaining to trust and/or interoperability for the purpose of interaction with and use of digital information resources and services. A Trustmark Relying Party may rely upon a Trustmark as the basis for third-party trust in the Trustmark Recipient with respect to the set of requirements represented by the Trustmark. A Trustmark Definition expresses the specific set of requirements represented by a Trustmark. A Trustmark Provider cryptographically signs and publishes various Trustmarks for organizations (Trustmark Recipients) that wish to obtain and use those Trustmarks as a mechanism for establishing trust with other entities (Trustmark Relying Parties), including partner organizations and individuals. These concepts and others together comprise the Trustmark Framework.
